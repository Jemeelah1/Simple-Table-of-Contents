      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to this article about the fascinating world of the Common Garden
        Snail. In this piece, we will explore its history, key characteristics,
        and some interesting facts about this often-overlooked creature.
      </p>

      <h2 id="history">History</h2>
      <p>
        The history of the Common Garden Snail (Cornu aspersum) is intertwined
        with human civilization. Originally native to the Mediterranean region,
        it has been spread by humans, both intentionally as a food source and
        unintentionally through trade and travel, to various parts of the world.
      </p>

      <h3 id="early-days">Early Days</h3>
      <p>
        Evidence suggests that snails have been consumed by humans since
        prehistoric times. Archaeological findings in the Mediterranean basin
        have uncovered snail shells in ancient middens, indicating their role in
        early human diets.
      </p>

      <h3 id="major-developments">Major Developments</h3>
      <p>
        The Romans are known to have cultivated snails in "cochlearia" or snail
        gardens. This practice highlights the early recognition of snails as a
        food delicacy. Over centuries, as trade routes expanded, the Common
        Garden Snail found its way to new continents, establishing populations
        in regions like North America, Australia, and parts of Asia.
      </p>

      <h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
      <p>
        The Common Garden Snail possesses several distinctive features that
        allow it to thrive in diverse environments.
      </p>

      <h3 id="feature-one">The Shell</h3>
      <p>
        Its most prominent feature is its spiral shell, typically brownish with
        yellowish bands. The shell provides protection from predators and
        dehydration. The snail can retract its entire body into the shell when
        threatened.
      </p>

      <h3 id="feature-two">Locomotion and Mucus</h3>
      <p>
        Snails move using a muscular foot and secrete a trail of mucus. This
        mucus aids in locomotion by reducing friction and also helps the snail
        adhere to surfaces, even upside down. The mucus also plays a role in
        protecting the snail's soft body.
      </p>

      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Common Garden Snail, despite its small size and unassuming
        appearance, has a rich history and fascinating biological features. Its
        journey alongside human migration and its adaptation to new environments
        make it a remarkable example of life's resilience. Hopefully, this
        article has provided you with a greater appreciation for this ubiquitous
        inhabitant of our gardens.
